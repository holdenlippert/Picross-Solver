# Picross-Solver
This is a program I wrote to solve picross puzzles. It should be run as `python solve.py <specsfile>` where specsfile is a .txt file containing the puzzle clues (the `specs.txt` files are provided examples). This will solve every picross puzzle which can be solved with logic, but not those which require guessing.
